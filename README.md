Discord is a way to collaborate and have fun with people through video, voice, and text chat. You can create unique servers that you can invite your friends to.

# Getting Started:

After logging in either through GitHub or Google, you are prompted to create a server. Here, you can upload an image for your server and make a name for it. After creating your server, you will be redirected to it.

# Navigation

If you want to create another server, click the plus on the top right. Below that will be the servers you are a member of. At the bottom is where you can sign out, and change the theme.

# Server Navigation

Click the server header in the top left (name of your server). This will open a dropdown with options the following options
# ***Invite People***
    - This allows you to invite your friends to the server. To join a server, use the link provided by a server owner and enter it into your browser URL
# ***Server Settings***
    - This is where you can change the server image and name
# ***Manage Members***
    - This is where you can kick members and manage their roles (Admin, Moderator, and Guest). These roles are strictly for the management of the server. Admins have all functionality, Moderators can do all but delete the server, and Guests can only leave the server.
# ***Create Channel***
    - You can create three different types of channels (Text, Audio, and Video). To connect to a channel, click on it on the right sidebar. The channel you are currently in will be highlighted. Anyone connected to the channel can see messages, talk to other connected members, and video chat. Channels can be edited by name and type and new channels can also be created with the plus signs next to the channel subsections.
# ***Delete Server*** 
    - This removes the server and all those connected.

# Direct Messages
    - Below the channels in a server, you can see the members. Clicking on a member will take you to a direct message, where you can video call and text chat

# Chat Messages
    - Messages have capabilities for emojis and file attachments, either image or PDF. Messages can be edited or deleted by the owner of the message, moderators, and admins
