Discord is a way to collaborate and have fun with people through video, voice, and text chat. You can create unique servers that you can invite your friends to.

# Getting Started:

After logging in either through GitHub or Google, you are prompted to create a server. Here, you can upload an image for your server and make a name for it. After creating your server, you will be redirected to it.

# Navigation

If you want to create another server, click the plus on the top right. Below that, will be the servers you are a member of. At the bottom is where you can sign out, and change the theme.

# ***Server Navigation***

Click the server header in the top left (name of your server). This will open a dropdown with options -
