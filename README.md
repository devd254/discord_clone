Discord is a way to collaborate and have fun with people through video, voice, and text chat. You can create unique servers that you can invite your friends to.

# Getting Started:

After logging in either through GitHub or Google, you are prompted to create a server. Here, you can upload an image for your server and make a name for it. After creating your server, you will be redirected to it.

# Navigation

If you want to create another server, click the plus on the top right. Below that will be the servers you are a member of. At the bottom is where you can sign out, and change the theme.

# ***Manage Members***
This is where you can kick members and manage their roles (Admin, Moderator, and Guest). These roles are strictly for the management of the server. Admins have all functionality, Moderators can do all but delete the server, and Guests can only leave the server.

You can create three different types of channels (Text, Audio, and Video). To connect to a channel, click on it on the right sidebar. The channel you are currently in will be highlighted. Anyone connected to the channel can see messages, talk to other connected members, and video chat. Channels can be edited by name and type and new channels can also be created with the plus signs next to the channel subsections.
